# sql-challenge

In Module 9 you will find a folder called EmployeeSQL, withing that folder you have the following. 
- A folder named data - this will have the originally CSV files. 

- A folder named Data Analysis will have the sql file with the queries that were ran separately, with the results each time it was downloaded as a csv file and saved within this folder. 

- A png file name Data Modeling ERD Sketch which is just the sketch from quickdb.

- A sql file named data_engineering which is the file with the query on how to create the tables. Once they were created, I uploaded the data from the original CSV file one at a time.
